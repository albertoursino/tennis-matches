Do you want to keep track of the tennis matches you play?
--

**TennisMatches** allows you to create an **opponent's profile** and keep track of the **matches played** with that opponent, specifying the result of the match and more.

The opponent profile you create will help you remember who you played against and if you want to play them again...

The most interesting aspect of this app is the fact that you can have **statistics** at your fingertips.

The app is currently in development, stay tuned and if you need anything please [contact me](https://github.com/albertoursino)!
